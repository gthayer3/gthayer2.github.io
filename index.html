        <p>Hi, I'm Gabriel Thayer, an ambitious third-year IT student specializing in Cybersecurity at George Mason University. Through my academic journey at GMU, I have developed a strong foundation in technical, teamwork, and leadership skills, and I am committed to continuous learning.</p>
        <p>In addition to my studies, my role at Zeiders Enterprises in the Business Development Department has been crucial to enhancing my project management, business, and research skills. Zeiders has provided me with hands-on experiences in Contract Operations, Proposal Review, and Database Implementation, which has allowed me to understand the operations of Government Contracting around the DC area.</p>
        <p>I am now seeking opportunities to further expand my knowledge and gain hands-on experience through an internship or research program in the Business and Technology fields.</p>
